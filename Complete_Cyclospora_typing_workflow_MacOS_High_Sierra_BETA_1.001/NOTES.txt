#### FIRST THING TO DO BEFORE RUNNING THIS WORKFLOW

First you will need to go into this directory:

/Complete_Cyclospora_typing_workflow_MacOS_High_Sierra_BETA_1.001/EUKARYOTYPING

In this folder you will see a .zip file called "REFERENCE_POPULATION.zip"

Unzip it. If you want to use these files as your reference population, thats fine. Alternatively, remove them and replace them with a reference of your choosing.
