# The CDC _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ complete genotyping workflow

This repository contains the workflow developed by Joel Barratt at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for genotyping Cyclospora cayetanensis. This workflow is comprised of three modules that perform three major tasks required by CDC to identify genetically related clusters of Cyclospora cayetaneisis infections. 

 1. **MODULE 1** - Assign haplotypes to each specimen in accordance with the CDC typing method discussed [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/evaluation-of-an-ensemblebased-distance-statistic-for-clustering-mlst-datasets-using-epidemiologically-defined-clusters-of-cyclosporiasis/F13FB2483E3DE1CF5C33706B4A1A7182).

 2. **MODULE 2** - Examine the genotype information generated by MODULE 1 and assess the relationship between each possible pair of specimens using this information. This second module is based on an updated version of the CDCs Eukaryotyping ensemble discribed [here](https://github.com/Joel-Barratt/Eukaryotyping).

 3. **MODULE 3** - Will predict the most appropriate number of clusters in the population under analysis using a set of reference specimens of known genetic linkage.

## Getting started

>These instructions will help you set up and run this code on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes for information on how to deploy the project on a live system.

This code was developed and tested using a Mac running OSX Catalina 10.15.3. Subsequent instructions are provided _only_ for installing it on an OSX system.

First create a local copy of this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:Joel-Barratt/Complete-Cyclospora-typing-workflow.git` 

### Prerequisites for OSX Catalina

>Prerequisites for installation of this code

#### Xcode Command Line Tools

Install Xcode

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Check Xcode is included in your $PATH (e.g., /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)

```bash
xcode-select -p
```

#### Local R package

Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), download and install `R-3.6.3.pkg (notarized, for Catalina)`

Check that R is correctly installed

```bash
R -h   # this should return a help print out with options for R  
```

#### Other prerequisites

There are several other essential prerequisites and dependencies that must be installed in order to run this workflow correctly. This section will be updated in the future. Please stand by for updates.


### Running this code

>While in the Complete_Cyclospora_typing_workflow_MacOS_High_Sierra_BETA_1.001 directory with all the files from the cloned github run (example):

```bash
bash MODULE_1_hap_caller.sh \
-D TEST_DATA \
-C  /path/to/where/you/unzipped/this/software \
-L 10 \
-R 500 \
-T 10 \
-H Y
```
> This will identify the haplotypes in 2 test samples. A produce a genotype file should be produced for two specimens _C_TEST1_20_ and _C_TEST2_20_ in the Complete_Cyclospora_typing_workflow_MacOS_High_Sierra_BETA_1.001/HAPLOTYPE_CALLER_CYCLO_V2/SPECIMEN_GENOTYPES/ directory. A new haplotype data sheet will also be generated in the Cyclospora_typing_workflow_MacOS_High_Sierra_BETA_1.001/haplotype_sheets directory. To understand the arguments supplied, while in the  Complete_Cyclospora_typing_workflow_MacOS_High_Sierra_BETA_1.001 directory with all the files from the cloned github run:

```bash
bash MODULE_1_hap_caller.sh -h
```
>This should provide a brief help listing all possible arguments.

## Additional Information on Project Participation

For additional detailed information on how to run these workflows and how to participate in this project please contact the authors of this [manuscript](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/genotyping-genetically-heterogeneous-cyclospora-cayetanensis-infections-to-complement-epidemiological-case-linkage/0C51FBFFB172DF50357C1D171E9B8657) and this [manuscript](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/evaluation-of-an-ensemblebased-distance-statistic-for-clustering-mlst-datasets-using-epidemiologically-defined-clusters-of-cyclosporiasis/F13FB2483E3DE1CF5C33706B4A1A7182#fndtn-information) directly to ensure your work remains compatible with the CDCs Cyclospora cayetanensis genotyping procedures.
