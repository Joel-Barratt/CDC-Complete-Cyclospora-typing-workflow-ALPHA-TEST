### Module 3 Background


This module was designed to select the most appropriate number of clusters from a hierarchical tree (a dendrogram) generated from an ensemble distance matrix calculated by Module 2. Heirarchical clustering is a nested clustering approach meaning that all smaller clusters are nested, falling within larger clusters. Therefore, manual (human) assignment of a discrete number of clusters to a hierarchical tree can drastically bias the interpretation of which specimens are related. Under these circumstances, assuming a smaller number of clusters results in a larger number of specimens being considered genetically similar and could culminate in the superficial linkage of specimens that may not be related to the same point of exposure. Alternatively, assuming many discrete clusters may lead to the ultra-fine separation of specimens that are closely related but not identical. Module 3 was developed to reduce these biases. It utilizes an internal set of reference specimens to inform an approximate discrete cluster number that would reflect a groups of genetically linked specimens that likely come from a common source of exposure. First, these reference specimens must be included in the calculation of an ensemble matrix alongside the test population (eg. Specimens from the current cyclosporiasis season). Module 3 then explores a range of possible cluster numbers (provided by the user) to determine the cluster number which results in all specimens within each cluster being as similar to each other (on average) as the internal reference set of closely related specimens. In this way, a cluster number is selected based on the distance observed within that specific matrix between a set of reference specimens that are known to be linked genetically and epidemiologically.
