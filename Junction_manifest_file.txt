# First part: defining some basic things
# In this example, we just give a name to the assembly

# As special parameter, we want to use 4 threads in parallel (where possible)

##number of threads is not.
## mrl is minimum read length
##[percent_required(pr)=integer â‰¥ 1] Default is dependent of the sequencing technology used and assembly quality wished. Controls the relative ##percentage of exact word matches in an approximate overlap that has to be reached to accept this overlap as possible match. Increasing this ##number will decrease the number of possible alignments that have to be checked by Smith-Waterman later on in the assembly, but it also might ##lead to the rejection of weaker overlaps (i.e. overlaps that contain a higher number of mismatches).
# -AL is alignment
